Advanced Software Engineering Assignment 1

Part 1:
This assignment was done in Java to create a console based UI for querying the CIA Factbook database at
"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/". The UI consists of textual prompts that assist
the user in inputting options and parameter values to conduct searches.

Upon program start, the user is confronted with a list of options, 1-5 (which correspond with the assignment
queries) as well as an option to relist the options or quit the program.

Example Output:

Welcome! Use this application to query the CIA World Factbook.
Here are your options:
1 : List countries in "South America" that are prone to "earthquakes".
2 : List countries in "Asia" with more than "10" political parties.
3 : Find all countries that have the color "blue" in their flag.
4 : Find all landlocked countries.
5 : Find a list of lat/long coordinates and countries/capitals that can be visited, maximizing the number visited where capitals are within "10" degrees of each other.
list-options : Relists these options.
quit : Exits the program.

Enter an option:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 1)
Returns a list of countries in a specified continent that are susceptible to a specified natural disaster. The implementation
for this consists of a compiling a hashtable of countries with keys of the continent names the countries belong to using data
from "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2145.html". Something to note is that France is considered
to be a part of many regions by the CIA Factbook, but I hard coded it so that it is only considered a part of Europe.
Then using that hashtable, I can find the countries within the specified continent to fetch the specific urls to the country 
profile pages from "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/textversion.html". Then by fetching the html 
data from the country profile pages, I can traverse the DOM to the "Natural hazards" header and read the data below. Then by doing a simple
word search, I can search for the presence of the specified disaster.

Example Output:

Enter an option: 1
Enter a continent: Asia
Enter a disaster type: tsunami
Time to query: 1.55 seconds
--------------------------------------
Your query has returned the following:
China
Japan
Maldives

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 2)
Returns a list of countries in a specified continent that have at more than a specified number of political parties. The
implementation for this is done in much the same way as that of Option 1. A list of continent-country mappings is
compiled into a hashtable. Then after looking up the continent specified, I find the country profile pages of the relevant
countries. Then by doing a simple DOM traversal I navigate to the header "Political parties" and do a count of the
semicolon separated political parties.

Example Output:

Enter an option: 2
Enter a continent: South America
Enter a count: 5
Time to query: 0.741 seconds
--------------------------------------
Your query has returned the following:
Argentina
Bolivia
Brazil
Chile
Colombia
Ecuador
Guyana
Paraguay
Peru
Suriname
Venezuela

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 3)
Returns a list of countries with the specified color in their flags. The implementation for this consists of searching
the html document fetched from "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/textversion.html" for
all the hyperlinked profile pages. Then I loop through them and hit each profile page, looking for the "Flag description"
header which describes colors on the flag. A simple word search for the color specified in the "Flag description" field
will determine whether or not that country name needs to be returned.

Example Output:

Enter an option: 3
Enter a flag color: brown
Time to query: 13.092 seconds
--------------------------------------
Your query has returned the following:
American Samoa
Sint Maarten

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 4)
Returns a list of landlocked countries. The implementation for this is similar to that of Option 3 in that I hit each
country profile page and look for the "Coastline" field header. The description for that field directly says "(landlocked)"
for countries that are landlocked, so those countries are returned if that keyword is present.

Example Output:

Enter an option: 4
Time to query: 12.943 seconds

Afghanistan

Option 5)
Returns a list of capitals (and the countries they belong to) that are within a certain degree range of each other.
The implementation of this consists of first querying the HTML document data from the page 
"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/textversion.html", which contains data about
capitals, the countries they belong to, and their geographical coordinates. It is assumed that anything listed
with a "(capital)" keyword is a capital to be considered for this problem. After compiling a list of capitals and
related data, I generated the powerset of the list. Then by checking each powerset for the fulfillment of the
distance condition, I found the set of geographic capitals that have the most points to determine the best
vacation pathing.

The distance condition I used is based on a rectangular model. As long as a square with sides of length of the maximum
distance specified can fit over both geographic regions, then I consider the two regions to be within required
range of each other.

The performance of this algorithm varied widely depending on the distance considered, and thus the amount of geographical
points considered. Some sample outputs for varied distance inputs are below. WARNING: for inputs of 10+ degrees, the
program can take upwards of 20 minutes to complete.

Example Outputs:

Enter an option: 5
Enter a maximum distance in degrees: 1
Time to generate subsets: 0.107
Time to query: 0.107 seconds

Considerations:

I used an external java package to manage the web requests to the CIA Factbook site. The Jsoup package provided HTML document fetching
and CSS Selector parsing. Documentation and source can be found at "http://jsoup.org/" as well as in the source files of this assignment.
